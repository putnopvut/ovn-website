--------------------------
  - Refactor CoPP commands introducing a unique name index in CoPP NB table.
    Add following new CoPP commands to manage CoPP table:
    - ovn-nbctl copp-add <name> <proto> <meter>
    - ovn-nbctl copp-del <name> <proto>
    - ovn-nbctl copp-list <name>
    - ovn-nbctl ls-copp-add <name> <switch>
    - ovn-nbctl lr-copp-add <name> <router>
  - Support version pinning between ovn-northd and ovn-controller-vtep as an
    option. If the option is enabled and the versions don't match,
    ovn-controller-vtep will not process any DB changes.
  - When configured to log packtes matching ACLs, log the direction (logical
    pipeline) too.
  - Introduce exclude-lb-vips-from-garp in logical_switch_port column in order
    to not advertise lbs VIPs in GARPs sent by the logical router.
  - ACLs now have an "options" column for configuration of extra options.
  - A new ACL option, "log-related" has been added that allows for reply and
    related traffic to be logged for an ACL in addition to the traffic that
    directly matches the ACL.
