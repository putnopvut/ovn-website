Release Notes:
```
OVN v20.12.0 - 18 Dec 2020
--------------------------
   - The "datapath" argument to ovn-trace is now optional, since the
     datapath can be inferred from the inport (which is required).
   - The obsolete "redirect-chassis" way to configure gateways has been
     removed.  See ovn-nb(5) for advice on how to update your config if needed.
   - Add IPv4 iPXE support introducing "bootfile_name_alt" option to ovn dhcp
     server.
   - Support other_config:vlan-passthru=true to allow VLAN tagged incoming
     traffic.
   - Propagate currently processed SB_Global.nb_cfg in ovn-controller to the
     local OVS DB integration bridge external_ids:ovn-nb-cfg.
   - Support version pinning between ovn-northd and ovn-controller as an
     option. If the option is enabled and the versions don't match,
     ovn-controller will not process any DB changes.
   - Add "fair" column in Meter table to allow multiple ACL logs to use the
     same Meter while being rate-limited independently.
   - New configuration option for northd 'options:use_logical_dp_groups=true'
     to enable combining of logical flows by logical datapath.  This should
     significantly decrease size of a Southbound DB.  However, in some cases,
     it could have performance penalty for ovn-controller.  Disabled by
     default.
